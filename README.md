### 🔐 `static/pgp/` Directory Structure

This directory contains public PGP key files and their corresponding QR codes.

```bash
static/
├── pgp/
│   ├── contact@s.neteng.pro.asc       # Public key for secure email
│   ├── pgp-contact.png                # QR code (PNG) for secure email key
│   ├── pgp-contact.webp               # Optimized WebP version of the QR code
│   ├── pgp-security.png               # QR code (PNG) for security contact key
│   ├── pgp-security.webp              # WebP version of the security QR code
│   ├── pgp-support.png                # QR code (PNG) for support key
│   ├── pgp-support.webp               # WebP version of the support QR code
│   ├── security@s.neteng.pro.asc      # Public key for security contact
│   ├── support@neteng.pro.asc         # Public key for general support
└── ...
```

- `.asc` files are **excluded from service worker precaching** but served directly via the `/pgp/[key]` route.
- QR code images are **served statically** by the `/pgp` route using `<picture>` elements.
- **WebP versions** are also used in the `/pgp` route, while the `/about` route imports **dynamic equivalents** from `src/lib/img/qr`.
- This route does **not use fallback rendering**; only explicitly defined files are available and expected to resolve.
- A dynamic `[key]/+server.js` handler under `src/routes/pgp/` serves the `.asc` files with appropriate `Content-Type` and download headers.

&nbsp;

### E2E Test Structure

End-to-end tests are located in `tests/e2e/` and organized by feature or route:

```bash
tests/
├── e2e/
│   ├── app.spec.js       # Desktop and mobile route tests
│   ├── mobile.spec.js    # Mobile-specific assertions
│   └── shared/
│       └── helpers.js    # Shared test utilities (e.g., getFooter, setDesktopView, setMobileView)
└── ...
```

<section id="configuration">

## 🛡️ Configuration

This project includes custom runtime configuration files for enhancing security, error handling, and PWA functionality. These modules are used by the framework during server- and client-side lifecycle hooks.

### 🔐 `hooks.server.js`

Located at `src/hooks.server.js`, this file is responsible for injecting dynamic security headers. It includes:

- A Content Security Policy (CSP) configured with relaxed directives to permit inline scripts and styles (`'unsafe-inline'`)
- A Permissions Policy to explicitly disable unnecessary browser APIs
- Standard security headers such as `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy`

> ℹ️ A stricter CSP (excluding `'unsafe-inline'`) was attempted but reverted due to framework-level and third-party script compatibility issues. The current policy allows inline scripts to ensure stability across SvelteKit and analytics features such as PostHog.

#### Future Improvements

To implement a strict nonce-based CSP in the future:

1. Add nonce generation and injection logic in `hooks.server.js`
2. Update all inline `<script>` tags (e.g. in `app.html`) to include `nonce="__cspNonce__"`
3. Ensure any analytics libraries or dynamic scripts support nonced or external loading

Note: Strict CSP adoption may require restructuring third-party integrations and deeper framework coordination.

> 💡 The `[headers]` block in `netlify.toml` has been deprecated — all headers are now set dynamically from within SvelteKit.

&nbsp;

### 🧭 `hooks.client.ts`

Located at `src/hooks.client.ts`, this file is currently limited to handling uncaught client-side errors via the `handleError()` lifecycle hook.

Client-side PWA logic (such as handling the `beforeinstallprompt` event, checking browser compatibility, and registering the service worker) has been moved to `src/lib/registerServiceWorker.js` for better modularity and testability.

> 💡 This separation ensures that error handling is isolated from PWA lifecycle logic, making both concerns easier to maintain.

<section id="sw-utilities">

## ⚙️ Service Worker Utilities

This project includes modular service worker management to support PWA functionality, update lifecycles, and debugging workflows.

### ✅ `registerServiceWorker.js`

Located at `src/lib/registerServiceWorker.js`, this module handles:

- **Service worker registration** (`service-worker.js`)
- **Update lifecycle**: prompts users when new content is available
- **Cache hygiene**: removes unexpected caches not prefixed with `cache-`
- **Install prompt support**: dispatches a `pwa-install-available` event for custom handling
- **Firefox compatibility**: skips registration in Firefox during localhost development

This function is typically called during client boot from `+layout.svelte` or another root-level component.

> ℹ️ The service worker will not register if the `?nosw` flag is present or if `window.__DISABLE_SW__` is set (see below).

&nbsp;

### 🧹 `unregisterServiceWorker.js`

Located at `src/lib/unregisterServiceWorker.js`, this utility allows for manual deactivation of service workers during debugging or user opt-out flows.

It unregisters **all active service worker registrations** and logs the result.

&nbsp;

### 🚫 `disableSw.js`

Located at `static/disableSw.js`, this file sets a global flag if the URL contains the `?nosw` query parameter:

```js
if (location.search.includes('nosw')) {
  window.__DISABLE_SW__ = true;
}
```

This flag is used by `registerServiceWorker.js` to bypass registration. It's helpful for testing environments, browser compatibility checks, or simulating first-load conditions without service worker interference.

To use:

```bash
https://netwk.pro/?nosw
```

> 💡 `disableSw.js` is loaded via a `<script>` tag in `app.html` from the `static` directory. This ensures the `__DISABLE_SW__` flag is set before any service worker logic runs.

&nbsp;

#### 🔧 Example Usage

To register the service worker conditionally, call the function from client code:

```js
import { registerServiceWorker } from '$lib/registerServiceWorker.js';

registerServiceWorker();
```

You can optionally import unregisterServiceWorker() in a debug menu or settings panel to let users opt out of offline behavior.

<section id="debug">

## `?debug=true` Query Parameter

Appending `?debug=true` to the URL enables debug logs in the browser console, even in production builds. This is useful for confirming:

- The current runtime environment (`development` vs. `production`)
- Query parameter parsing behavior
- Whether certain client-side features are properly initialized

```bash
https://netwk.pro/?debug=true
```

> 💡 This flag does not persist across navigation or reloads. It simply triggers console logs during initial mount to aid in troubleshooting and QA.

</section>

---

<section id="cspreport">

## 📣 CSP Report Handler

This project integrates with a dedicated CSP reporting endpoint, implemented as a [Netlify Edge Function](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/) and hosted separately at:

- <https://csp.netwk.pro/.netlify/functions/csp-report>
- Source: [netwk-pro/csp-endpoint](https://github.com/netwk-pro/csp-endpoint)

The endpoint receives Content Security Policy (CSP) violation reports and logs details for inspection. High-risk violations (e.g., `script-src`, `form-action`) also trigger real-time alerts via [`ntfy`](https://ntfy.sh/). You can extend this further by integrating with SIEM platforms, logging tools, or notification systems.

### Usage

To enable reporting, make sure your CSP headers include both the legacy `report-uri` and the modern `report-to` directives.  
This project’s `hooks.server.js` already configures both, along with the required `Report-To` header:

```http
# Example response headers
Content-Security-Policy: ...; report-uri https://csp.netwk.pro/.netlify/functions/csp-report; report-to csp-endpoint;

Report-To: {
  "group": "csp-endpoint",
  "max_age": 10886400,
  "endpoints": [
    { "url": "https://csp.netwk.pro/.netlify/functions/csp-report" }
  ],
  "include_subdomains": true
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses a mix of automated performance, accessibility, and end-to-end testing tools to maintain quality across environments and deployments.

| Tool                                                         | Purpose                                              | Usage Context       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| [`@playwright/test`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-intro) | End-to-end testing framework with browser automation | Local + CI          |
| [`@lhci/cli`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) | Lighthouse CI — automated performance audits         | CI (optional local) |
| [`lighthouse`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse)   | Manual/scripted Lighthouse runs via CLI              | Local (global)      |

> **Note:** `lighthouse` is intended to be installed globally (`npm i -g lighthouse`) or run via the `lighthouse` npm script, which uses the locally installed binary if available. You can also run Lighthouse through Chrome DevTools manually if preferred.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->

> CI uses Chrome for Lighthouse audits. For local experimentation, you may run Lighthouse manually using [Brave](https://brave.com), which can reveal differences related to privacy features or tracking protection.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD028 -->

&nbsp;

### Testing Configuration Files

| File                   | Description                                                              | Usage Context |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| `playwright.config.js` | Configures Playwright test environment (browsers, timeouts, base URL)    | Local + CI    |
| `.lighthouserc.cjs`    | Lighthouse CI config for defining audit targets, budgets, and assertions | CI            |

&nbsp;

### E2E Setup

Playwright is included in `devDependencies` and installed automatically with:

```bash
npm install
```

To install browser dependencies (required once):

```bash
npx playwright install
```

> This downloads the browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) used for testing. You only need to run this once per machine or after a fresh clone.

&nbsp;

### Running Tests

Local testing via Vitest and Playwright:

```bash
npm run test:client     # Run client-side unit tests with Vitest
npm run test:server     # Run server-side unit tests with Vitest
npm run test:all        # Run full test suite
npm run test:watch      # Watch mode for client tests
npm run test:coverage   # Collect code coverage reports
npm run test:e2e        # Runs Playwright E2E tests (with one retry on failure)
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->

> The unit test suite includes a coverage audit (`auditCoverage.test.js`) that warns when source files in `src/` or `scripts/` do not have corresponding unit tests. This helps track test completeness without failing CI.

> Playwright will retry failed tests once `(--retries=1)` to reduce false negatives from transient flakiness (network, render delay, etc.).

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD028 -->

Audit your app using Lighthouse:

```bash
# Run Lighthouse CI (via @lhci/cli) using the current build
npm run lhci:run
```

Manual auditing with Lighthouse (e.g., via Brave or Chrome):

```bash
# Install globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g lighthouse

# Run Lighthouse manually against a deployed site
lighthouse https://netwk.pro --view
```

You can also audit locally using Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse tab for on-the-fly testing and preview reports.

> The repo uses `@lhci/cli` for CI-based audits. It is installed as a dev dependency and does not require a global install.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->

> To trace the exact Chrome version and audit timestamp used in CI:
>
> ```bash
> cat .lighthouseci/chrome-version.txt
> ```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->
